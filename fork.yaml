              description: |
                The Bedrock upgrade introduces a Deposit transaction-type (0x7E) to enable both users and the rollup system itself to change the L2 state based on L1 events and system rules as [specified](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/deposits.md).

              description: |
                The Transaction type now exposes the deposit-transaction and L1-cost properties required for the rollup.

            - title: "L1 cost computation"
              description: |
                Transactions must pay an additional L1 cost based on the amount of rollup-data-gas they consume, estimated based on gas-price-oracle information and encoded tx size.

              description: |
                Deposit transactions have special processing rules: gas is pre-paid on L1, and deposits with EVM-failure are included with rolled back changes (except mint). For regular transactions, at the end of the transition, the 1559 burn and L1 cost are routed to vaults.

          description: |
            The rollup functionality is enabled with the optimism field in the chain config. The EIP-1559 parameters are configurable to adjust for faster more frequent and smaller blocks. The parameters can be overriden for testing.

        - title: "Engine API modifications"
          description: |
            The Engine API is extended to insert transactions into the block and optionally exclude the tx-pool, to reproduce the exact block of the sequencer from just the inputs, as derived from L1 by the rollup-node. See [L2 execution engine specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/exec-engine.md).

        - title: "Block-building modifications"
          description: |
            The block-building code (in the “mining” stages because of Proof-Of-Work legacy of ethereum) implements the changes to support the transaction-inclusion, tx-pool toggle and gaslimit parameters of the Engine API.
